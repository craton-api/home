# Getting started

Unform is a performance focused library that helps you creating beautiful forms in React with the power of uncontrolled components performance and React Hooks.

## Install

Unform always needs the `core` package and one package based on the client type:

### Web (ReactJS)

```sh
yarn add @unform/core @unform/web
```

### Mobile (React Native)

```sh
yarn add @unform/core @unform/mobile
```

You're done! ðŸŽ‰

You can now proceed to [Basic Form](/guides/basic-form) example.
